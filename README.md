UFO Prowl & Tic Tac Toe are strictly windows-only programs and their purpose is mainly recreational, as they are meant to entertain their players.

## How does it work?

#### Upon starting the program, you will have two buttons available to choose from, each one having the role of starting the game written on them.

## UFO Prowl

#### The main goal in this game is to catch as many cows as possible before the bar at the bottom side of the window ends.

#### You do that by controlling the UFO, being able to either go left or right. (you can use the <- and -> arrows, or the A and D keys). The score can be seen on the upper-right side of the window.

#### One important aspect of this game is that hitting a car with the UFO will result in losing the game.
#### Also, not all cars are stationary. Some will move in order to make the game a little more harder and less predictable.

## Tic Tac Toe

#### At first you'll have two options to choose from:
#### - Singleplayer:

#### - Multiplayer:

#### Depending on which option is opted for, you'll have to provide either one or two names for the players.

#### The game offers a score for the number of wins and draws. It can be reset by clicking File - New Game. 
#### To change from one mode to another (Singleplayer/Multiplayer), you have to click File - Change Mode.

#### I'd like to mention that building the AI for the singleplayer mode was the most entertaining part of this game. In the end, I managed to make the gameplay feel quite challenging.


## ðŸ“Œ FAQ

#### How was the process of building "UFO Prowl" and "Tic Tac Toe" like?

These 2 games together have been a change of pace from my previous projects and they have been done as a recreational activity. 

Overall, working on them was entertaining and refreshing. They helped me gain an understanding of how physics and AI work in videogames while also giving me the opportunity to perfect my skills.
